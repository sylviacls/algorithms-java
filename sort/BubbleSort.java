/***
 * Bubble sort is a simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements 
 * and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list
 * is sorted. 
 * 
 * The whole array is setted as unsortedPartition (index = leght- 1) 
 * Transverse left to right until the unsortedPartition
 * "Bubbles" the largest values to the top
 * Repeatedly steps through the list and compare adjacents elements and swap them if 
 * they are in wrong order.
 * 
 * In-place Algorithm (Memory complexity): Its made a logical partition between Sorted and Unsorted. 
 * Only local variables are used and that doesn't depende on the size of number you're sorting 
 * We don't have to create another array.
 * 
 * O(nÂ²) time-complexity
 * It's a stable algorith
 * We can make a pre-ordering (like shell sorting) and then performer the bubble sort
