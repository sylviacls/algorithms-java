/*
 - "Similar" to InsertionSort but use a larger gap value (insertion use gap of 1) 
    to reduce the amount of shiffting
 - It makes a pre-ordering before performe a pure Insertion
 - Compare elements that are in a distance apart rather than adjacent
 - We calculte the "gap" for each pass (kenuth sequence (3^k - 1/2) or floor (n/2)) until is 1
 - When gap is 1 it will be performance the inserion sort but with list partially ordered

 - Worst case O(nÂ²), but it can perform much better than that
- It's an unstable algorith (InserionSort is stable)
