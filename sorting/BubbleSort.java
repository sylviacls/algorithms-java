/*
-  The whole array is setted as unsortedPartition (index = leght- 1) 
-  Transverse left to right until the unsortedPartition
- "Bubbles" the largest values to the top
- Repeatedly steps through the list and compare adjacents elements and swap them if they are in wrong order.
- In-place Algorithm (Memory complexity): Its made a logical partition between Sorted and Unsorted. 
  Only local variables are used and that doesn't depende on the size of number you're sorting 
  We don't have to create another array.

- O(nÂ²) time-complexity
- It's a stable algorith
- We can make a pre-ordering (like shell sorting) and then performer the bubble sort
